Firefighters continuously run the risk of dying as the world progressively moves toward automated systems and self-driving cars. If a fire is not put out, it spreads quickly. Therefore, our system steps in to solve this problem and protect the life of our hero. The Arduino Uno development board powers this firefighting robotic system, which also has a fire flame sensor for spotting oncoming fires and a water tank and spray mechanism for putting out the flames. For optimal coverage, a water spraying nozzle is attached to a servo motor. A water pump is used to transfer water from the main water tank to the water nozzle.
